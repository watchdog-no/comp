 * extraction pass scores conservatively from the user's Q&A signals only
 * (no posture data), so it lands a lot of well-attested vendors at the
 * generic middle. Once research has collected certifications, type, and
 * description, we can ground the score in actual evidence and refine.
 *
 * Idempotent: safe to re-run for the same (vendorId, organizationId)
